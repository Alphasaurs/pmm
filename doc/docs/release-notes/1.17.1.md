# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.17.1


* **Date**

    February 20, 2019


*PMM* ([Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html)) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, and *PostgreSQL* performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, and *PostgreSQL* servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

In this release, we are introducing support for detection of our upcoming PMM 2.0 release in order to avoid potential version conflicts in the future, as PMM 1.x will not be compatible with PMM 2.x.

Another improvement in this release is we have updated the Tooltips for Dashboard MySQL Query Response Time by providing a description of what the graphs display, along with links to related documentation resources.

The authentication system used in PMM is not susceptible to the attacks described in these CVE reports. PMM does not use client-side data objects to control user-access.

In release 1.17.1 we have included 2 Improvements and fixed 9 bugs.
