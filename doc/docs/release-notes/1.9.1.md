# *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.9.1


* **Date**

    April 12, 2018


This release contains bug fixes only and supersedes *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.9.0. This release
effectively solves the problem in QAN when the *Count* column
actually displayed the number of queries per minute, not per second,
as the user would expect. The following screenshot demonstrates the
problem. The value of the *Count* column for the **TOTAL** row is
**649.38** *QPS* (queries per second). The total number **38.96
k** (38960) is only sixty times greater than the reported value of
QPS. Thus, queries were counted for each minute within the selected
time range of `Last 1 hour`.

**Query Analytics in PMM version** 1.9.0.

The corrected version of QAN in PMM 1.9.1 shows that queries
are now counted per second. The total number of queries is **60** \*
**60** greater than the value of *QPS*, as should be expected for the
chosen time range.
