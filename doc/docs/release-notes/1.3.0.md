# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.3.0


* **Date**

    September 26, 2017


For install and upgrade instructions, see Deploying Percona Monitoring and Management.

In release 1.3.0, Percona Monitoring and Management introduces
a basic support for the MyRocks storage engine. There is a special
dashboard in **Metrics Monitor** where the essential metrics of
MyRocks are presented as separate graphs. And **Metrics
Monitor** graphs now feature on-demand descriptions.

There are many improvements to QAN (Query Analytics) both in the user interface
design and in its capabilities. In this release, **QAN** starts
supporting all types of MongoDB queries.

**Orchestrator** is not enabled by default because leaving it in a
non-configured state was confusing to users. It is still possible to
enable it.
