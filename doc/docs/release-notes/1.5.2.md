# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.5.2


* **Date**

    December 5, 2017


Percona announces the release of *Percona Monitoring and Management*
1.5.2. This release contains fixes to bugs found after *Percona Monitoring and Management*
1.5.1 was released.

## Bug fixes


* [PMM-1790](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1790): QAN would display query metrics even for a host that was not
configured for `mysql:queries` or `mongodb:queries`. We have fixed the
behaviour to display an appropriate warning message when there are no query
metrics for the selected host.


* [PMM-1826](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1826): If PMM Server 1.5.0 is deployed via Docker, the
Update button would not upgrade the instance to a later release.


* [PMM-1830](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1830): If PMM Server 1.5.0 is deployed via AMI instance,
the Update button would not upgrade the instance to a later release.
