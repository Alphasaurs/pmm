* **Date**

    November 23, 2017


Percona announces the release of *Percona Monitoring and Management*
1.5.0, with a focus on the following features:


* Enhanced support for MySQL on Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora – Dedicated Amazon
Aurora dashboard offers maximum visibility into key database characteristics,
eliminating the need for additional monitoring nodes.  We renamed Amazon RDS
OS Metrics to Amazon RDS /
Amazon
MySQL Metrics


* Simpler configuration – *Percona Monitoring and Management* now offers easier
configuration of key Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora settings via a web interface


* One-click data collection – One button retrieves vital information on server
performance to assist with troubleshooting


* Improved interface – A simple, consistent user interface makes it faster and
more fluid to switch between *PMM Query Analytics* and Metrics Monitor

*Highlights from our new Amazon RDS / Aurora MySQL Metrics dashboard:*

dashboard known as PMM.

With this release, *Percona Monitoring and Management* introduces a new deployment
option via AWS Marketplace.  This is in addition to our distribution method of
[Amazon Machine Images (AMI)](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/ami.html).

In this release, Grafana and Prometheus have been upgraded. PMM now includes
Grafana 4.6.1. One of the most prominent features that the upgraded Grafana
offers is the support of annotations. You can mark a point or select a region in
a graph and give it a meaningful description. For more information, see the
[release highlights](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/whats-new-in-v4-6/).

Prometheus version 1.8.2, shipped with this release, offers a number of bug
fixes. For more information, see the
[Prometheus change log](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#182--2017-11-04).
