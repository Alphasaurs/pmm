## Changes in PMM Server


* [PMM-667](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-667): Fixed the *Latency* graph
in the *ProxySQL Overview* dashboard
to plot microsecond values instead of milliseconds.


* [PMM-800](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-800): Fixed the *InnoDB Page Splits* graph
in the *MySQL InnoDB Metrics Advanced* dashboard
to show correct page merge success ratio.


* [PMM-1007](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1007): Added links to Query Analytics
from *MySQL Overview* and *MongoDB Overview* dashboards.
The links also pass selected host and time period values.

**NOTE**: These links currently open QAN2,
which is still considered experimental.

## Changes in PMM Client


* [PMM-931](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-931): Fixed `pmm-admin` script
when adding MongoDB metrics monitoring for secondary in replica set.
