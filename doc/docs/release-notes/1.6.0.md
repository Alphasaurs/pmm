# *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.6.0


* **Date**

    January 18, 2018


Percona announces the release of *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.6.0. In this release, PMM
Grafana metrics are made available in the *Advanced Data Exploration*
dashboard. The integration with MyRocks has been improved and its data are now
collected from *SHOW GLOBAL STATUS*.

The MongoDB exporter now features two new metrics: **mongodb_up** to inform if the
MongoDB Server is running and **mongodb_scrape_errors_total** reporting the total
number of errors when scaping MongoDB.

In this release, the performance of the `mongodb:metrics` monitoring service
has been greatly improved.

PMM 1.6.0 also includes version 4.6.3 of Grafana which includes fixes to
bugs in the alert list and in the alerting rules. More information is available
in the
