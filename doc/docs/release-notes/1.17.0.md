# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.17.0


* **Date**

    November 20, 2018


*PMM* ([Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html)) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, and *PostgreSQL* performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, and *PostgreSQL* servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

In release 1.17.0 we made 6 improvements and fixed 11 bugs.

Although we patched a bug this release related to a Grafana CVE announcement,
previous releases since 1.10 (April 2018) were not vulnerable, and we encourage
you to see our [Grafana CVE blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/11/20/how-cve-2018-19039-affects-percona-monitoring-and-management) for further details.

## Dashboard Improvements

We updated five Dashboards with improved Tooltips - If you haven’t seen this
before, hover your mouse over the `i` icon in the top left of most graph
elements, and you’ll see a new box appear.  This box provides a brief
description of what the graph displays, along with links to related
documentation resources so you can learn further.  We hope you find the content
useful!

1. MySQL Amazon Aurora Metrics


2. MySQL MyISAM/Aria Metrics


3. MySQL Replication


4. Prometheus Exporters Overview


5. Trends

We hope you enjoy this release, and we welcome your feedback via the [Percona PMM Forums](https://percona.com/forums/questions-discussions/percona-monitoring-and-management/)!
