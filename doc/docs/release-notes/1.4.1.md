## Bug fixes

* [PMM-1620](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1620): In some cases, PMM could not be upgraded to version 1.4.0 by using the Update button on the landing page.
* [PMM-1633](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1633): QAN would show error List of Tables is Empty for instances having been upgraded from earlier releases of PMM, due to incorrect values being stored in the database.  This has been addressed to identify the incorrect values and replace with accurate schema and table information.
* [PMM-1634](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1634): The *Advanced Data Exploration* dashboard did not always display data points from `external:metrics` monitoring services due to a too restrictive Grafana Template filter.

* [PMM-1636](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1636): Special characters prevented the removal of `external:metrics` services using the **pmm-admin remove** command.
