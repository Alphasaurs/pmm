# *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.9.0


* **Date**

    April 4, 2018


There are a number of significant updates in 1.9.0 that we hope you
will like, some of the key highlights include:


* Faster loading of the index page: We have enabled performance
optimizations using **gzip** and **HTTP2**.


* AWS improvements: We have added metrics from CloudWatch RDS to 6
dashboards, as well as changed our AWS add instance workflow, and
made some changes to credentials handling.


* Percona Snapshot Server: If you are a Percona Customer you can now
securely share your dashboards with Percona Engineers.


* Exporting PMM Server logs: Retrieve logs from PMM Server for
troubleshooting using single button-click, avoiding the need to log
in manually to the docker container.


* Low RAM support: We have reduced the memory requirement so
PMM Server will run on systems with 512MB


* Dashboard improvements: We ave changed MongoDB instance
identification for MongoDB graphs, and set maximum graph Y-axis on
Prometheus Exporter Status dashboard

## AWS Improvements

### CloudWatch RDS metrics

Since we are already consuming Amazon Cloudwatch metrics and persisting them in
Prometheus, we have improved 6 node-specific dashboards to now display
Amazon RDS node-level metrics:


* Cross_Server (Network Traffic)


* Disk Performance (Disk Latency)


* Home Dashboard (Network IO)


* MySQL Overview (Disk Latency, Network traffic)


* Summary Dashboard (Network Traffic)


* System Overview (Network Traffic)

### AWS Add Instance changes

We have changed our AWS add instance interface and workflow to be more clear on
information needed to add an Amazon Aurora MySQL or Amazon RDS MySQL
instance. We have provided some clarity on how to locate your AWS credentials.

### AWS Settings

We have improved our documentation to highlight connectivity best practices, and
authentication options - IAM Role or IAM User Access Key.

## Low RAM Support

You can now run PMM Server on instances with memory as low as 512MB RAM, which
means you can deploy to  the free tier of many cloud providers if you want to
experiment with PMM.  Our memory calculation is now:

```
METRICS_MEMORY_MULTIPLIED=$(( (${MEMORY_AVAIABLE} - 256*1024*1024) / 100 * 40 ))
if [[ $METRICS_MEMORY_MULTIPLIED < $((128*1024*1024)) ]]; then
    METRICS_MEMORY_MULTIPLIED=$((128*1024*1024))
fi
```

## Percona Snapshot Server

Snapshots are a way of sharing PMM dashboards via a link to individuals who do
not normally have access to your PMM Server.  If you are a Percona Customer
you can now securely share your dashboards with Percona Engineers.  We have
replaced the button for sharing to the Grafana publicly hosted platform onto one
administered by Percona.  Your dashboard will be written to Percona
snapshots and only Percona Engineers will be able to retrieve the data.  We
will be expiring old snapshots automatically at 90 days, but when sharing you
will have the option to configure a shorter retention period.

## Export of PMM Server Logs

In this release, the logs from PMM Server can be exported using single
button-click, avoiding the need to log in manually to the docker container.
This simplifies the troubleshooting process of a PMM Server, and especially for
Percona Customers, this feature will provide a more consistent data gathering
task that you will perform on behalf of requests from Percona Engineers.

## Faster Loading of the Index Page

In version 1.8.0, the index page was redesigned to reveal more useful
information about the performance of your hosts as well an immediate access to
essential components of PMM, however the index page had to load much data
dynamically resulting in a noticeably longer load time. In this release we
enabled **gzip** and **HTTP2** to improve the load time of the index page. The
following screenshots demonstrate the results of our tests on webpagetest.org
where we reduce page load time by half.  We will continue to look for
opportunities to improve the performance of the index page and expect that when
we upgrade to Prometheus 2 we will see another improvement.
