[Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html) (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, and *PostgreSQL* performance.

The PMM 1.17.3 release provides fixes for the following bugs.

## Fixed Bugs


* [PMM-5089](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5089) and [PMM-5119](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5119): The handlebars package was updated to
version 4.5.3 because of the Prototype Pollution vulnerability in it
(CVE-2019-19919), and the serialize-javascript package was updated to version
2.1.1 because of the possibility of regular expressions cross-site scripting
vulnerability in it (CVE-2019-16769); PMM versions were not affected by these
vulnerabilities, as both packages were used as build dependencies only


* [PMM-4923](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4923): Textfile collector was not working after the upgrade from
older versions on CentOS 7, producing a lot of errors in the log, due to the
`textfile_collector` folder incorrectly created as `textfile-collector`


* [PMM-5075](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5075): Switching to First Seen queries in Query Analytics resulted in
always displaying first seen queries even after switching back.


* [PMM-5014](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5014) and [PMM-5273](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5273): The LVM logical volumes autoresize problem
on new AWS deployments resulted in “no space left on device” errors


* [PMM-4685](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4685): After removing all MongoDB servers from a cluster, the
drop-down list on the MongoDB Overview dashboard still included the cluster
name, because dashboards were fully refreshed on load only, irrelative to the
selected time range


* [PMM-4789](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4789): the “Metrics” and “Query’s first seen” text labels were
partially overlapping in the Query Analytics dashboard


* [PMM-5231](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5231): Panic errors were present in the `rds_exporter` log after
adding an RDS instance from the second AWS account, leaving user no
possibility to add Databases from several AWS accounts for monitoring
