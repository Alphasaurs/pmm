# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.1.4


* **Date**

    May 29, 2017


For install and upgrade instructions, see Deploying Percona Monitoring and Management.

This release includes experimental support for MongoDB in Query Analytics,
including updated QAN interface.

## Query Analytics for MongoDB

To enable MongoDB query analytics, use the `mongodb:queries` alias
when adding the service.
As an experimental feature, it also requires the `--dev-enable` option:

```
sudo pmm-admin add --dev-enable mongodb:queries
```

**NOTE**: Currently, it monitors only collections that are present
when you enable MongoDB query analytics.
Query data for collections that you add later is not gathered.
This is a known issue and it will be fixed in the future.

## Query Analytics Redesign

The QAN web interface was updated for better usability and functionality
(including the new MongoDB query analytics data).
The new UI is experimental and available by specifying `/qan2`
after the URL of *PMM Server*.

**NOTE**: The button on the main landing page
still points to the old QAN interface.

You can check out the new QAN web UI at [https://pmmdemo.percona.com/qan2](https://pmmdemo.percona.com/qan2)
