## Bug fixes


* [PMM-1271](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1271): In QAN, when the user selected a database host with no
queries, the query monitor could still show metrics.


* [PMM-1512](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1512): When reached from **Grafana**, **QAN**
would open its home page. Now, **QAN** opens and automatically
selects the database host and time range active in **Grafana**.


* [PMM-1523](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1523): User defined Prometheus memory settings were not
honored, potentially causing performance issues in high load
environments.

Other bug fixes in this release:
[PMM-1452](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1452),
[PMM-1515](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1515).
